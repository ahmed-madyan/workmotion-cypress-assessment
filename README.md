<!-- ABOUT THE Repo -->
## About The Repo


There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.


Use the `README.md` to get started.


### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* [![Node][Node.js]][Node-url]
* [![Cypress][Cypress.io]][Cypress-url]


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

First, make sure you have all the [system requirements](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements).

### Prerequisites

Download the [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) source code or a pre-built installer for your platform, and start developing today.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
