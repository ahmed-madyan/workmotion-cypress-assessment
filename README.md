<!-- ABOUT THE Repo -->
## About The Repo


There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.


Use the `README.md` to get started.


### Built With

* [![Node][Node.js]][Node-url]
* [![Cypress][Cypress.io]][Cypress-url]


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

First, make sure you have all the [system requirements](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements).

### Prerequisites

Download the [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) source code or a pre-built installer for your platform, and start developing today.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Navigate to the Repo URL at [GitHub](https://github.com/ahmed-madyan/workmotion-cypress-assessment)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone
   ```
3. Install npm packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Install Cypress via npm 
   ```sh
   cd /your/project/path
   ```
   ```sh
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```
5. Open Cypress test runner
   The long way with the full path
   ```sh
   ./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
   ```
   Or with the shortcut using npm bin
   ```sh
   $(npm bin)/cypress open
   ```
